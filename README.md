# opsem-team

Home of the operational semantics team.

The opsem team is the successor of the unsafe-code-guidelines working group and responsible for
answering many of the difficult questions about the semantics of unsafe Rust. It is also a subteam
of the [lang team][lang-team]. For more information about the team, see the [RFC][rfc] in which it
was created. For an up-to-date list of members, see the [governance section of the
website][members].

[rfc]: https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/3346-t-opsem.html
[members]: https://www.rust-lang.org/governance/teams/lang#Operational%20Semantics%20team

This repo is used primarily for procedural items like meeting proposals. For technical discussions
around unsafe code, see the [unsafe code guidelines repo][ucg-repo] instead.

### Chat

Outside of the UCG repo, much of the team's discussion happens [in the `#t-opsem` stream on Zulip][zulip].
